# Cohort Analysis using SQL 
This project uses SQL to perform a cohort retention analysis on an online retail dataset to understand customer behavior and drop-off trends over time. Customers are grouped by their first purchase month, and their activity is tracked to calculate retention rates.

Key tasks included:

Handling missing data

Extracting date features

Assigning cohorts and cohort indices

Creating and analyzing retention tables

The dataset, sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, contains transactions from a UK-based online gift retailer between December 2010 and December 2011, with many customers being wholesalers.
