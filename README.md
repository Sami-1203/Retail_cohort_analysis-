# Cohort Analysis using SQL 
This project involves a cohort analysis of an online retail dataset using SQL to explore customer trends and behavior over time. Cohort analysis is a method that groups users based on shared characteristics, such as their first purchase month, to track patterns like retention. The goal is to apply key data analysis skills, including:

Handling missing values


Extracting month from dates


Assigning cohorts to transactions


Calculating cohort index


Creating a retention table


Interpreting retention rates


The dataset comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and includes transactions from a UK-based online gift retailer between December 1, 2010, and December 9, 2011. Many of the customers are wholesalers.
